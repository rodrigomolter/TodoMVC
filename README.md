# TodoMVC
In this project I will cover the test scenarios, test cases for the [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com).<br>
The tests executions can be executed manually but some of them will also be automated.

TodoMVC is a project which has offered the same Todo applications implemented in popular JavaScript frameworks for the last decade.

In this particullar case, I used the [TodoMVC made with React](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/), but it work with all the examples.
