TodoMVC is a project which has offered the same Todo applications implemented in popular JavaScript frameworks for the last decade.

In this project I will cover the test scenarios and test cases for the [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com).<br>
The tests can be executed manually and some of them are automated and you can check how to run them below.

In this particullar case, I used the [TodoMVC made with React](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/), but it work with all the examples listed in the main page. 

## User Stories 👤
All the User Stories are described in the [User Stories page](https://dynamic-keeper-66c.notion.site/User-Stories-491da01d74b94342acdf5a1166315f24).
